# Configuration file for the Bluetooth service

# This section contains options which are not specific to any
# particular interface
[General]

# Default adapter name
# Defaults to 'BlueZ X.YZ'
Name = AndroidAuto-Dongle

# Default device class. Only the major and minor device class bits are
# considered. Defaults to '0x000000'.
#Class = 0x000100

# How long to stay in discoverable mode before going back to non-discoverable
# The value is in seconds. Default is 180, i.e. 3 minutes.
# 0 = disable timer, i.e. stay discoverable forever
DiscoverableTimeout = 0

# How long to stay in pairable mode before going back to non-discoverable
# The value is in seconds. Default is 0.
# 0 = disable timer, i.e. stay pairable forever
PairableTimeout = 0

# Use vendor id source (assigner), vendor, product and version information for
# DID profile support. The values are separated by ":" and assigner, VID, PID
# and version.
# Possible vendor id source values: bluetooth, usb (defaults to usb)
#DeviceID = bluetooth:1234:5678:abcd

# Do reverse service discovery for previously unknown devices that connect to
# us. This option is really only needed for qualification since the BITE tester
# doesn't like us doing reverse SDP for some test cases, most notably
# PTS-GAR-BV-02-C.
# Defaults to 'true'.
ReverseServiceDiscovery = true

# Enable name resolving after inquiry. Set it to 'false' if you don't need
# remote devices name and want shorter discovery cycle. Defaults to 'true'.
NameResolving = true

# Enable runtime persistency of debug link keys. Default is false which
# makes debug link keys valid only for the duration of the connection
# that they were created for.
DebugKeys = false

# Restricts all controllers to the specified transport. Default value
# is "dual", i.e. both BR/EDR and LE enabled (when supported by the HW).
# Possible values: "dual", "bredr", "le"
#ControllerMode = dual

# Enables Multi Profile Specification support. This allows to specify if
# system supports only Multiple Profiles Single Device (MPSD) configuration
# or both Multiple Profiles Single Device (MPSD) and Multiple Profiles Multiple
# Devices (MPMD) configurations.
# Possible values: "off", "single", "multiple"
#MultiProfile = off

# Permanently enables the Fast Connectable setting for adapters that
# support it. When enabled other devices can connect faster to us,
# however the tradeoff is increased power consumptions. This feature
# will fully work only on kernel version 4.1 and newer. Defaults to
# 'false'.
# Orange Pi has better power handling, so enable fast connectable
FastConnectable = true

# Default privacy setting.
# Enables use of private address.
# Possible values: "off", "device", "network"
# "network" option not supported currently
# Defaults to "off"
# Privacy = off

# Specify the policy to used when accepting new incoming pairing
# requests.
# Possible values: "always", "never", "blacklist"
# Defaults to "always"
Authorize = always

# Provide an extended inquiry response (EIR) device ID. By default,
# the device ID provided in the EIR is all zeros. Some devices can
# treat this as an unset value and may not properly detect the
# device in their device listings. If needed, set this to a different
# value. Setting this to "random" will generate a random Device ID
# at runtime.
#DeviceID = random

[Policy]

# The ReconnectUUIDs defines the set of remote services that should try
# to be reconnected to in case of a link loss (link supervision
# timeout). The policy plugin should contain a sane set of values by
# default, but this list can be overridden here. By setting the list to
# empty the reconnection feature gets disabled.
# Increased number of UUIDs to reconnect for better reliability
ReconnectUUIDs=00001112-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb,00001105-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb,0000110a-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb,0000110c-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb,0000110e-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb,00001112-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb,00001116-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb,0000111f-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb,0000112f-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb,00001132-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb,00001200-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb,00001800-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb,00001801-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb

# AutoEnable defines option to enable all controllers when they are found.
# This includes adapters present on start-up, adapters that are plugged in
# later on. Defaults to 'false'.
AutoEnable = true

# Audio devices that were disconnected due to suspend will be reconnected on
# resume. ResumeDelay determines the delay (in seconds) between the system
# resuming and the attempt to reconnect the devices being made. The default
# is 2 seconds.
# Reduced resume delay for faster reconnection
ResumeDelay = 1

# Automatically connect both A2DP and HFP/HSP profiles for incoming
# connections. Some headsets have the feature that only use a single
# button press to connect to a device supporting both HSP/HFP and
# A2DP, but the device is only interested in one of the profiles.
# The AutoConnect option makes it possible to disable automatic
# connection of the other profile.
# Defaults to 'true'.
# Improve auto-connection behavior for Orange Pi
AutoConnect = true
